# Open Source City ‚Äî Your Way

## Who Owns the City? Your Imagination Builds Ours

### Vision
- Digitize and open-source physical urban infrastructure.
- Release urban data and designs as digital assets on the global stage.
- Circulate as NFTs on the Solana blockchain to create a new urban economy.

## üåç What's the Problem?

Urban planning and development today face multiple challenges:

- **High Development Risk**: Developers and municipalities incur enormous financial risks in early-stage urban projects.
- **Disempowered Participation**: Citizens often lack meaningful ways to participate in decision-making, turning cities into impersonal systems.
- **Declining Local Identity**: Regional areas are suffering from depopulation and the loss of unique cultural character ‚Äî an indirect but critical issue.

## üõ†Ô∏è What We're Building

### üåç Fully Open-Source City Development Platform

A decentralized, participatory urban design platform with simulation and NFT-powered economic mechanisms.

#### ‚ú® Virtual Trials & Pop-up Tests
- Try-and-error prototyping in virtual spaces.
- Real-world validation through short-term popup implementations.

#### ‚ú® Predictive Governance Model
- Uses **Futarchy**  to guide urban planning based on predicted resident satisfaction.
- Citizens vote not on policies but on desired outcomes: "Do I want to live here?"

#### ‚ú® Data-Driven Economic Layer
- Collect and analyze architectural and behavioral data.
- Sell design analytics and implementation reports as a new revenue model.

### Technologies I used

**1.Model Evaluation through FID and Human Insights**

We adopted a method combining FID and human evaluations for LLM assessment. FID was used to objectively assess quality and diversity, and World was utilized to verify human authenticity rather than bots. Finally, reviews were conducted by human evaluators from diverse backgrounds. Tokens were distributed to evaluators to encourage fair and accurate evaluations.
