## üåç What's the Problem?

Urban planning and development today face multiple challenges:

- **High Development Risk**: Developers and municipalities incur enormous financial risks in early-stage urban projects.
- **Disempowered Participation**: Citizens often lack meaningful ways to participate in decision-making, turning cities into impersonal systems.
- **Declining Local Identity**: Regional areas are suffering from depopulation and the loss of unique cultural character ‚Äî an indirect but critical issue.
