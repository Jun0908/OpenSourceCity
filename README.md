# Open Source City — Your Way

## Who Owns the City? Your Imagination Builds Ours

### Vision
- Digitize and open-source physical urban infrastructure.
- Release urban data and designs as digital assets on the global stage.
- Circulate as NFTs on the Solana blockchain to create a new urban economy.

## 🌍 What's the Problem?

Urban planning and development today face multiple challenges:

- **High Development Risk**: Developers and municipalities incur enormous financial risks in early-stage urban projects.
- **Disempowered Participation**: Citizens often lack meaningful ways to participate in decision-making, turning cities into impersonal systems.
- **Declining Local Identity**: Regional areas are suffering from depopulation and the loss of unique cultural character — an indirect but critical issue.

## 🛠️ What We're Building

### 🌍 Fully Open-Source City Development Platform

A decentralized, participatory urban design platform with simulation and NFT-powered economic mechanisms.

#### ✨ Virtual Trials & Pop-up Tests
- Try-and-error prototyping in virtual spaces.
- Real-world validation through short-term popup implementations.

#### ✨ Predictive Governance Model
- Uses **Futarchy**  to guide urban planning based on predicted resident satisfaction.
- Citizens vote not on policies but on desired outcomes: "Do I want to live here?"

#### ✨ Data-Driven Economic Layer
- Collect and analyze architectural and behavioral data.
- Sell design analytics and implementation reports as a new revenue model.

## 📈 Business Model

**Target**: Real Estate & Urban Development Sector

### Pain Points
- **Consensus Risk**: 30–50% of urban development projects stall due to failure in public engagement.
- **Design & Delay Risk**: On average, design flaws and delayed decisions lead to 57% cost overruns.

### Value Proposition
- **Risk Reduction**: Virtual testing + resident-driven design via Futarchy reduces these risks by up to 80%.
- **Cost Savings**: Potential to save tens to hundreds of millions of yen per project.
- **Revenue**: SaaS-based tools with an annual licensing fee of approximately ¥10 million.

## 🔗 Blockchain Infrastructure

- All urban design contributions and participatory data minted as NFTs on **Solana**.
- Transparent, traceable contributions create a new public trust mechanism.

---

## 🌱 Next Steps

- Launch MVP featuring virtual simulation and NFT minting tools.
- Partner with local governments for pop-up trials.
- Release governance toolkit (Futarchy/Harberger funding simulator) for early adopters.

## 🌐 Towards a Decentralized Urban Future

We aim to redefine how cities are built — from exclusive top-down planning to inclusive, community-driven co-creation. Our mission is to turn urban planning into a participatory digital commons, making urban life fairer, smarter, and more responsive.

**Open Source City** is not just a tool — it is a movement.
