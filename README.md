# Open Source City ‚Äî Your Way

## Who Owns the City? Your Imagination Builds Ours

### Vision
- Digitize and open-source physical urban infrastructure.
- Release urban data and designs as digital assets on the global stage.
- Circulate as NFTs on the Solana blockchain to create a new urban economy.

## üåç What's the Problem?

Urban planning and development today face multiple challenges:

- **High Development Risk**: Developers and municipalities incur enormous financial risks in early-stage urban projects.
- **Disempowered Participation**: Citizens often lack meaningful ways to participate in decision-making, turning cities into impersonal systems.
- **Declining Local Identity**: Regional areas are suffering from depopulation and the loss of unique cultural character ‚Äî an indirect but critical issue.

## üõ†Ô∏è What We're Building

### üåç Fully Open-Source City Development Platform

A decentralized, participatory urban design platform with simulation and NFT-powered economic mechanisms.

#### ‚ú® Virtual Trials & Pop-up Tests
- Try-and-error prototyping in virtual spaces.
- Real-world validation through short-term popup implementations.

#### ‚ú® Predictive Governance Model
- Uses **Futarchy**  to guide urban planning based on predicted resident satisfaction.
- Citizens vote not on policies but on desired outcomes: "Do I want to live here?"

#### ‚ú® Data-Driven Economic Layer
- Collect and analyze architectural and behavioral data.
- Sell design analytics and implementation reports as a new revenue model.
